/*
    -> if you want to interact with smart contract the way that you use to do in remix IDE where it provide us a button,here we have to do:
        -> truffle develop
            -> and see the tiven port by truffle dev channel
        -> and past that port on 'truffle-config.js' file
        -> and then again do :
            -> truffle develop
            -> truffle migrate (inside the development environment, now this will create the instance of contract)
            -> let instance = await Demo.deployed()
            -> instance.setter(15)
            -> instance.getter()
